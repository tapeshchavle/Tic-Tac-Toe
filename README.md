# NOUGHTS AND CROSSES (Tic-Tac-Toe)
Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without any player aligning three marks, the game ends in a draw.
